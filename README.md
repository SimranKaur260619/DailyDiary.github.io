## Welcome to my Daily Diary

I started my 6 months training at Software Deveopment Centre, GNDEC from Jan,2022. But due to some reasons, I shifted my training to under the guidance of Dr. Amandeep Kaur Sohal (Assistant Professor) at Computer Science Department, GNDEC. I am keeping the record of my daily progress as DaliyDiary blog.

### Dated: 24 January,2022
Training at SDC:

My task 1 was to use GitHub Pages to represent the essential of Linux/Unix commands.

The approach I followed was implementing while learning. As I came across a command, after understanding the working, I implemented the same to see the results. Since I have Windows 10 as my operating system, I needed a Linux system to execute the commands. Firstly I installed the VirtualBox which is a Virtual Machine that helps to operate another OS in an existing system. After that I installed the Kali Linux 2021 version to run commands. After configuring the VM, I was able to run commands efficiently.

I used YouTube and  https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/ as a reference material.

Linux is important as a coder, but as I used Windows I got accustomed and comfortable while using it. But as I learned more about Linux, I came to understand its importance as a developer.

Screenshots serve as a proof of working of the system and are essential to provide a good impression in a report. It helps to easily understand the context of the presentation.

It took me at most 6 hours to complete all the work. It took me 1 hour to understand the working of GitHub and GitHub Pages as I was not familiar with it. Within 2-3 hours I was able to install the requirements as the size of files was huge and also internet speed mattered. 1-2 hour was for executing the commands, understanding the Linux commands, taking screenshots, and coding.

### Dated: 25-31 January,2022
Training at CSE Department:

My task was to search for various journals, articles, conference papers in the field of Wireless sensor networks and Internet of Things(IOT). 

I thoroughly searched for the reference material at various sites such as IEEE, SciDirect, Elsavier, etc. After searching the material, I read and understood the contents of papers while maintaining the notes.

### Dated: 1-2 February,2022
Continuing my research work, I also looked for various simulation tools and software for simulatig the wireless sensor network. I installed MATLAB software for the simulation. 

Since I was not familiar with the software, its working, shortcuts, syntax, etc. it took me some time to get started woth the software.

### Dated: 3-8 February,2022
Today, my task was to create a basic network in MATLAB. I was able to deploy some nodes at random and plot a graph for th same. 

In addition to this, I searched for some more content on Clustering protocols in WSN, Clusturing algorithms in WSN, etc.

### Dated: 9-13 February,2022
I continued my reading and searching of survey papers and making notes for the same. 

Also I got more familiar with MATLAB while creating and executing various programs.

### Dated: 14-28 February,2022
I had LASIK surgery and the doctor recommended rest for atleast 10 days. So I was not able to continue my work in this time period. 

### Dated: 1 March,2022
My task was to deploy nodes forming a network and a sink node where the nodes transmit and receive information. 

I needed to calculate the distance of each node from the sink node. 

Also I needed to entrust each node with some initial energy which it will use for communication. 

I also read a survey paper on Clustering Algorithms of WSN and made notes.

### Dated: 2-16 March,2022
After thorough research of clustering algorithms, we decided to use a machine learning K-means algorithm for formation of clusters. 

I tried and coded the K-means algorithm and developed a new modified K-means algorithm. 

It produced satisfying results.

### Dated: 17-31 March,2022
My marriage was on 21 March,2022 so in order to prepare for that I had to take leave for nearly 2 weeks.

### Dated: 1-15 April,2022
After the formation of clusters, I needed to assign cluster heads in order to make algorithm more efficient. 

Cluster heads are responsible for collecting data from the cluster members and transmit it to the sink or base station. Therefore, I reasearched some journals, research papers and articles for selection of CH. 

We decided to take reference from centroids obtained from the K-means algorithm to initialize the CH of each cluster. 

Selection of cluster head was based on the shortestt distance of sensor node form the centroids. The code ran successfully.

### Dated: 18-30 April,2022 
My next task was to make the algorithm energy efficient so I researched about various energy efficient algoithms in WSN and analysed and compared their outcomes. 

Applying some of the stategies, I tried to create a randomly deployed network where every sensor node can transmit the data and sink can receive the data. 

Initial energy was assigned to each node and energy of sink node was assumed as infinity. 

The residual energy of this basic network was calculates and analysed.

### Dated: 2-16 May,2022
I needed to apply the researched and developed energy conserving concept with formation of clusters. Therefore, I combined modified K-means clustering algorithm with
energy efficient strategies. 

I developed a code for energy consumption while transmission of data from cluster members to their respective CH. 

Also, CH had to receive data from the cluster members and transmit it to the sink. Therefore, more energy was consumed by CH. It was a challenging task as I needed to make it energy efficient. 

Therefore, I had to select a new CH after the previous CH was out of energy. I had to put the code in loop so as it selects a new CH every time the previous CH runs out of energy. The new cluster head was selected on the basis of shortest distance of cluster member from the sink so as to conserve energy.

The needed to run until all the nodes are drained out of energy and there is no network energy left for the transmission of data.

### Dated: 17-31 May,2022
I got severly sick due to congestion of chest. It was difficult breathing and doctor asked to take TB test. with the rest of nearly 2 weeks I got well and all the reports were good.

### Dated: 1-7 June,2022
After the completion of designed algorithm, I needed to compare the obtained results with an existing algorithm.

So, we decided to compare the proposed algorithm with LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive CLustering Hierarchy).

I researched and analysed the LEACH by studying various research papers and journals.

I applyed the LEACH algorithm in MATLAB. There were many challenges in the given task. The code resulted with many errors such as compile time, etc. However, after utilizing some time I was able to run it successfully.

### Dated: 8-10 June,2022
I compared the obtained results of proposed algorithm with LEACH and got satisfying results. 

The proposed algorithm was more energy efficient than LEACH.

After all the implementation, I prepared reports and presentations for the evaluation.
