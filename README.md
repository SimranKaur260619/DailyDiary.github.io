## Welcome to my Daily Diary

I started my 6 months training at Software Deveopment Centre, GNDEC from Jan,2022. But due to some reasons, I shifted my training to under the guidance of Dr. Amandeep Kaur Sohal (Assistant Professor) at Computer Science Department, GNDEC. I am keeping the record of my daily progress as DaliyDiary blog.

Training at SDC:

My task 1 was to use GitHub Pages to represent the essential of Linux/Unix commands.

The approach I followed was implementing while learning. As I came across a command, after understanding the working, I implemented the same to see the results. Since I have Windows 10 as my operating system, I needed a Linux system to execute the commands. Firstly I installed the VirtualBox which is a Virtual Machine that helps to operate another OS in an existing system. After that I installed the Kali Linux 2021 version to run commands. After configuring the VM, I was able to run commands efficiently.

I used YouTube and  https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/ as a reference material.

Linux is important as a coder, but as I used Windows I got accustomed and comfortable while using it. But as I learned more about Linux, I came to understand its importance as a developer.

Screenshots serve as a proof of working of the system and are essential to provide a good impression in a report. It helps to easily understand the context of the presentation.
It took me at most 6 hours to complete all the work. It took me 1 hour to understand the working of GitHub and GitHub Pages as I was not familiar with it. Within 2-3 hours I was able to install the requirements as the size of files was huge and also internet speed mattered. 1-2 hour was for executing the commands, understanding the Linux commands, taking screenshots, and coding.

Training at CSE Department:

My task was to search for various journals, articles, conference papers in the field of Wireless sensor networks and Internet of Things(IOT). I thoroughly searched for the reference material at various sites such as IEEE, SciDirect, Elsavier, etc. After searching the material, I read and understood the contents of papers while maintaining the notes.

Continuing my research work, I also looked for various simulation tools and software for simulatig the wireless sensor network. I installed MATLAB software for the simulation. Since I was not familiar with the software, its working, shortcuts, syntax, etc. it took me some time to get started woth the software.

### Dated 2-2-2022
Today, my task was to create a basic network in MATLAB. I was able to deploy some nodes at random and plot a graph for th same. In addition to this, I searched for some more content on Clustering protocols in WSN, Clusturing algorithms in WSn, etc.

### Dated 3-2-2022, 4-2-2022, 7-2-2022, 8-2-2022
I continued my reading and searching of survey papers and making notes for the same. Also I got more familiar with MATLAB while creating and executing various programs.

### Dated: 9-2-2022
Today my task was to deploy nodes forming a network and a sink node where the nodes transmit and receive information. I needed to calculate the distance of each node from the sink node. Also I needed to entrust each node with some initial energy which it will use for communication. I also read a survey paper on Clustering Algorithms of WSN and made notes.
